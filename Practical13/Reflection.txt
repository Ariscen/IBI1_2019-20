In this practical, we simulated the propagation of a probable disease with several constants given.
For me, finding errors of the code I wrote is the most difficult part, since there were some tiny problems, like the brackets missing, may result in big problems for the whole program.
There is no denying that the last part of the practical, which is the spatial expression, is the most impressive for me, as the "animation" is really amazing.
The most important thing in code I have learned after this practical is the use of two-dimensional arrays, while the most important thing for further study is the patience I have gained and improved through this practical.
