During this course, I have gained a deeper understanding of version control, Unix-like system and how do they work.
I have learnt and practiced how to use python to write some short programs, which are able to realize some simple functions.
For the problems during some practicals, I have learnt to solve the problems with patience and my self-study on online references.
Besides, learning to cooperate with other students is really beneficial for me to consolidate the knowledge and learn more perspectives to realize the same function.
In conclusion, I think this course is really important for a beginner in programming, like me, and it helps me to step into the gate of Biomedical informatics with knowledge and practice.
